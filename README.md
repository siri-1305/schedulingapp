# üñ•Ô∏è CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulator

A **Streamlit web application** that simulates popular CPU scheduling algorithms.  
Many online tools give wrong results ‚Äî this app ensures **accurate scheduling outcomes** for academic and practical use.

## üöÄ Features

- Supports **5 Scheduling Algorithms**:
  - **FCFS** (First Come First Serve)
  - **SJF (Non-Preemptive)** (Shortest Job First)
  - **SRTF (Preemptive)** (Shortest Remaining Time First)
  - **Round Robin (RR)** with custom time quantum
  - **Priority (Non-Preemptive)** (higher number = higher priority)

- Calculates:
  - Completion Time (CT)
  - Turnaround Time (TAT)
  - Waiting Time (WT)
  - Response Time (RT) *(for Round Robin only)*
  - Average TAT, WT, RT
  - Throughput & Schedule Length

- Interactive UI with **easy inputs**
- Built with **Python + Streamlit + Pandas**
